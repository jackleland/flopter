Standalone python package for the preparation and fitting/plotting (hence the name) of Langmuir probe data.

Very early days at the moment, as only contains the analysis scripts for dealing with SPICE2 data. Will be updated incrementally and possibly merged with the work being done by Matej in Prague.
